# Netflix Subscription Conjoint Analysis

This repository contains a hypothetical conjoint analysis study on Netflix subscription plans. The data is based on a forced-choice survey where respondents evaluated different subscription plans based on several attributes. Respondents were shown two hypothetical plans and had to select the preferable one.

## Project Overview

This analysis was completed as part of a bootcamp project created by Diogo Resende to gain experience using analytical tools in python. The goal was to understand how various features impact customer satisfaction and to identify the most valued attributes in a subscription plan.

## Survey Attributes

The survey included the following attributes:

1. **Number of Accounts**: 
   - Options: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

2. **Price**: 
   - Options: $8, $10, $12, $15, $18, $20

3. **Extra Content**: 
   - Options: 'HBO', 'Marvel', 'Disney', 'Soccer', 'Less Content', 'Prime Originals'

4. **Ads**: 
   - Options: 'one_per_day', 'one_per_show', 'none'

## Data and Analysis

The dataset represents fictional customer preferences collected through a forced-choice survey. The analysis includes calculating part-worth utilities for each attribute level to understand the impact of different features on customer satisfaction.
